## By the end of this 3 day session you should have:

- An app that showcases your CV, hosted on the internet for you to share with potential employers
- A meeting booking system, that lets potential employers schedule interviews that work for you and them
- Knowledge that you can deploy & run the same app on Android, IOS, Windows, MacOs, Linux
- Experience using a conversational AI tool
- A basic understanding of app development with Flutter

Some of these actions will contain commands you can / should type into a terminal, eg:

```dart
    echo "hello from the terminal"
```

## Basic terminology

`terminal` - you might know this as a command prompt or cmd window or something similar.

`browser` - you may also see mention of `web browser`. For the purpose of this course it is assumed that you are using Google Chrome.

## Using the terminal with this course

Where such commands are listed, you can either:
- read & type them to a terminal by hand

or:

- copy them to the clipboard using buttons at the bottom of the page (scroll down if you don't see them at the bottom of this page)
- paste them into a terminal, using `Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+V` depending on your operating system. If you are more comfortable with the mouse, right-click & `Paste` may be available.
